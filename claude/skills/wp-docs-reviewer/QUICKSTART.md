## Understanding Feedback

### Critical Issues (Red Flag üö®)
Must be fixed before publication:
- Accessibility violations
- Non-inclusive language
- Incorrect technical information
- Code that violates WordPress standards

### Important Issues (Yellow Flag ‚ö†Ô∏è)
Should be fixed for quality:
- Voice/tone inconsistencies
- Formatting problems
- Unclear instructions
- Missing descriptions

### Suggestions (Blue Flag üí°)
Nice to have:
- Style improvements
- Additional examples
- Enhanced clarity

## After Your Review

1. **Fix critical issues** immediately
2. **Address important issues** before publication
3. **Consider suggestions** for continuous improvement
4. **Learn patterns** to improve future documentation
5. **Re-review** if major changes were made

## Troubleshooting

### "The skill isn't triggering"
Make sure you mention:
- "WordPress documentation"
- "Review" or "check" or "audit"
- Style guide compliance

### "Feedback is too general"
Ask for:
- Specific line numbers
- Before/after examples
- Style guide references

### "Too many issues to fix"
Request:
- "Prioritize by impact"
- "Show me the top 5 issues"
- "What blocks publication?"
